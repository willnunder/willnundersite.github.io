      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>This is my work. Using my combined medical training, business education and programming background I have created multidisiplinary platforms </p>
      <br>

      <p> I have international experience in all fields. From my time in Montreal, Toronto, Manhattan, Prague, Managua and St. George I have taken the time to observe different health systems and how they could improve. Additionally aspects in certain systems that could be transfered. </p>
      <br>
      <p> In my spare time I have a deep interest in the football world. And have taken the time to build a match predictive platform that is currently in the works, and is this far very promising. </p>
